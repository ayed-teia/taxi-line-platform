## 🎯 Driver Matching QA Verification

### Test Scenarios

Execute these tests to verify driver matching logic works correctly.

#### Prerequisites
- [ ] At least 2 drivers with accounts
- [ ] All drivers have `drivers/{driverId}` documents with `lastLocation`
- [ ] Firebase emulators running
- [ ] Manager dashboard open to observe transitions

---

### Test 1: Only Online+Available Drivers Receive Requests

| # | Setup | Action | Expected Result |
|---|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 1.1 | Driver A: Online+Available | Passenger requests trip | Driver A receives request |
| 1.2 | Driver A: Online, Driver B: Offline | Passenger requests trip | Only Driver A receives request |
| 1.3 | Driver A: Online+Busy (on trip) | Passenger requests trip | Driver A does NOT receive request |
| 1.4 | All drivers: Offline | Passenger requests trip | Error: "No drivers available" |

**Log to verify:**
```
🔍 [CreateTrip] Querying available drivers...
🚗 [CreateTrip] Found {N} available driver(s)
```

---

### Test 2: Nearest Driver Selected (Haversine)

| # | Setup | Action | Expected Result |
|---|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 2.1 | Driver A: 1km from pickup | Passenger requests trip | Driver A selected |
| 2.2 | Driver A: 5km, Driver B: 2km | Passenger requests trip | Driver B selected (nearer) |
| 2.3 | Driver A: 1km, Driver B: 1km (tie) | Passenger requests trip | First in query result selected |

**Log to verify:**
```
✅ [CreateTrip] Selected driver: {driverId}
   distance: X.XX km
   totalCandidates: N
```

---

### Test 3: Driver Becomes Unavailable on Accept

| # | Action | Expected Result | Firestore Check |
|---|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 3.1 | Driver accepts trip | isAvailable → false | `drivers/{driverId}.isAvailable = false` |
| 3.2 | Same driver for next request? | NOT selected | Query excludes busy drivers |
| 3.3 | Manager dashboard | Shows driver as "Busy" 🟠 | Real-time update |

**Log to verify:**
```
🚗 [AcceptTrip] Driver isAvailable → false
```

---

### Test 4: No Two Drivers Get Same Trip

| # | Scenario | Expected Result |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| 4.1 | Trip created | Only 1 driver assigned in `trips/{tripId}.driverId` |
| 4.2 | Rapid accept attempts | Transaction prevents double accept |
| 4.3 | Second driver tries to accept | Error: "Trip already accepted" |

**Log to verify:**
```
⚠️ [AcceptTrip] Trip already accepted - blocking
```

---

### Test 5: Rejected Trip Makes Driver Available Again

| # | Action | Expected Result | Firestore Check |
|---|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 5.1 | Driver rejects trip | isAvailable → true | `drivers/{driverId}.isAvailable = true` |
| 5.2 | Trip status | → no_driver_available | `trips/{tripId}.status = 'no_driver_available'` |
| 5.3 | Driver eligible for next trip | Yes | Can receive new requests |

**Log to verify:**
```
📝 [RejectTrip] Trip status → no_driver_available
🚗 [RejectTrip] Driver isAvailable → true
```

> ⚠️ **MVP Limitation:** Rejected trips are NOT reassigned to next driver. Future enhancement planned.

---

### Test 6: Manager Sees All Transitions Live

| # | Action | Manager Dashboard Shows |
|---|--------|------------------------|
| 6.1 | Driver goes online | 🟢 Online, ✅ Available |
| 6.2 | Driver accepts trip | 🟢 Online, 🚗 Busy |
| 6.3 | Trip appears | Active Trips table + map markers |
| 6.4 | Driver completes trip | 🟢 Online, ✅ Available |
| 6.5 | Trip moves to completed | Removed from active trips |
| 6.6 | Pending trip (no driver) | ⏳ Pending Requests table |

---

### Driver Matching QA Sign-off

| Test | Tester | Date | Status |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| Online+Available Only | | | ⬜ |
| Nearest Driver | | | ⬜ |
| Unavailable on Accept | | | ⬜ |
| No Double Assignment | | | ⬜ |
| Reject → Available | | | ⬜ |
| Manager Live View | | | ⬜ |

## �🔧 Known Issues & Workarounds

### 1. Firebase Auth in Expo Go
**Error:** `Component auth has not been registered yet`

**Cause:** Firebase JS SDK 10.x has async component registration that conflicts with Expo Go's bundling.

**Workaround:** 
- Error is caught and handled gracefully
- App continues to function without blocking
- For full Auth: Use **Development Build** (`npx expo run:ios` or `npx expo run:android`)

### 2. AsyncStorage Version Mismatch
**Warning:** `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage@1.24.0 - expected version: 2.2.0`

**Cause:** Firebase Auth requires AsyncStorage 1.x, Expo SDK 54 expects 2.x

**Status:** Does not block app functionality
